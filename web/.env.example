# Your Supabase anon/public key (starts with eyJ...)
# IMPORTANT: This MUST be the "anon" or "public" key from your Supabase project settings.
# Look for the key under: Project Settings -> API -> Project API keys -> anon (public)
# This key is safe to use in the browser for read operations.
# 
# ⚠️ DO NOT use the "service_role" key here! Using the service role key will cause:
# "Forbidden use of secret API key in browser" error
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=

# (Optional) Your Supabase service role key for server-side operations
# ⚠️ WARNING: This key has FULL access to your database and should NEVER be exposed to the browser!
# This should ONLY be used in API routes (server-side code).
# If not set, the anon key will be used for all operations (which is fine for most use cases).
# 
# To find this key: Project Settings -> API -> Project API keys -> service_role (secret)
