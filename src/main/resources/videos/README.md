# Winner Videos

Place your winner celebration videos in this folder:

- `red_winner.mp4` - Played when Red Alliance wins
- `blue_winner.mp4` - Played when Blue Alliance wins

## Requirements

- Format: MP4 (H.264 codec recommended)
- Resolution: Match your stream output resolution (e.g., 1920x1080 or 1280x720)
- Duration: Short celebratory clips work best (5-15 seconds recommended)

## Behavior

When the user clicks "Show Final Results":
1. The appropriate winner video plays full-screen
2. After the video ends, the final results overlay appears
3. The winning alliance is highlighted with a "WINNER" badge

If the video files are not found, the final results will be shown immediately without video playback.
